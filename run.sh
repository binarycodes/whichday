Tasks:
  deps       Download newly added dependencies (every other task builds offline)
  compile    Compile sources (triggers a devtools hot-restart of a running app)
  bundle     Clear cached frontend bundles + touch styles.css + recompile
             (use after changing a @CssImport themeFor / @JsModule)
  styles     Touch styles.css so the browser reloads @imported CSS partials
  test       Run the unit tests (enforces the JaCoCo coverage gate)
  verify     Unit tests + Playwright integration tests (mvn clean verify)
  run        Start the app with spring-boot:run (dev mode)
  preview    Alias of run, launched by the Claude Code preview pane
  package    Full production build (mvn clean package)
  clean      mvn clean + remove cached bundles
  help       Show this message
